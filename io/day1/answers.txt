Answer:

Weakly or strongly typed: Io is dynamically, strongly typed. It remembers all the types used and does not do any implicit conversions. The moment an operation is done on two distinct types Io raises an exception.

1 + "one" -> exception
"one" + 1 -> exception
1 + 1 -> 2


Is 0 true or false? 0 is true: 0 and true gives true
Empty string? empty string is true: "" and true gives true
Nil? Nil is false: nil and true gives false

How can we tell what slots a protype supports? By using the proto message on an object

What is difference between =, := and ::=

= only assigns a value to an existing slot. Use this to update a value that already exists.
:= creates a slot and assigns the value. Use this to assign a value to a new variable or create new method on an object
::= creates a slot and automatically creates a setter method on the object and assigns the value. Use this to initially set value of a variable in an object.
